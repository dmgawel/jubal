# What is Jubal?

Jubal is a simple web tool that lets you compose song slides for your church or ministry. Feed Jubal with prepared slides and then it lets you select songs for today, arrange them and download ready-to-use PDF file.

## Disclaimer

Jubal was originally created in 2014 as a quick project for Academic Ministry "Maciejówka" (Wrocław, Poland). It was not actively developed since then but I've decided to open source it and let others make us of it. More instructions and commits are coming.
